            is a community of practice (CoP) that is developed on, and is maintained using the Internet.
            To qualify as an OCoP, the characteristics of a community of practice (CoP) as described by Lave
            and Wenger must be met. To this end, an OCoP must include active members who are practitioners,
            or "experts," in the specific domain of interest. Members must participate in a process of collective
            learning within their domain.[1] Additionally, social structures must be created within the community to
            assist
