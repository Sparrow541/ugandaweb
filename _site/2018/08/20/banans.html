of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</p>

and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich instarch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.his forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it.
